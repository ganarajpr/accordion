Accordion component for angular using bootstrap.


You use the accordion component as a new html markup ( as is the convention in angular )


<accordion>
        <group title="Layers">
            This defines a new accordion group.
        </group>
        <group title="Works">
            This is another group

        </group>
    </accordion>
